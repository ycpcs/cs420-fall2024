1) Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times 
indicated.  Each process will run for the amount of time listed.  In answering 
the questions, use nonpreemptive scheduling, and base all decisions on the 
information you have at the time the decision must be made.


    Process    Arrival Time    Burst Time
    -------    ------------    ----------
      P1            0              8
      P2            2              4
      P3            3              1

1a) [3 points] Draw a Gantt chart for the provided process using the FCFS 
scheduling algorithm.  What is the average turnaround time for these processes?

1b) [3 points] Draw a Gantt chart for the provided process using the SJF 
scheduling algorithm.  What is the average turnaround time for these processes?




2) [3 points] Why is it important for the scheduler to distinguish I/O-bound 
programs from CPU-bound programs?




3) Consider the following set of processes, with the length of the CPU burst 
given in milliseconds:

    Process    Burst Time    Priority
    -------    ----------    --------
      P1            8            3
      P2            3            1
      P3            2            2
      P4            1            4
      P5            6            2
      

The processes are assumed to have arrived in the order:
P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, all at time 0.

3a) [3 points] Draw a Gantt chart that illustrates the execution of these 
processes using the FCFS scheduling algorithm. THEN, for each process, compute 
the turnaround time as well as the waiting time.

3b) [3 points] Draw a Gantt chart that illustrates the execution of these 
processes using the SJF scheduling algorithm. THEN, for each process, compute 
the turnaround time as well as the waiting time.

3c) [3 points] Draw a Gantt chart that illustrates the execution of these 
processes using the nonpreemptive priority scheduling algorithm. THEN, for each 
process, compute the turnaround time as well as the waiting time.  In cases 
where you have a tie, choose the process with the smaller process number first.

3d) [3 points] Draw a Gantt chart that illustrates the execution of these 
processes using the round robin scheduling algorithm (quantum = 1). THEN, for 
each process, compute the turnaround time as well as the waiting time.

3e) [3 points] Which of the algorithms results in the minimum average waiting 
time (over all processes)?




4) [3 points] Consider the following set of processes, with the arrival times 
and length of the CPU bursts given in milliseconds:

    Process    Arrival Time    Burst Time
    -------    ------------    ----------
      P1            0              5
      P2            1              1
      P3            3              1
      P4            3              2
      P5            6              4


Draw a Gantt chart that illustrates the execution of these processes using the
shortest-remaining-time-first scheduling algorithm. THEN, for each process, 
compute the turnaround time as well as the waiting time.




5) [3 points] Which of the following scheduling algorithms could result in 
starvation? Select all that apply.

a) First-come, first served
b) Shortest job first
c) Round robin
d) Priority




6) [3 points] Consider a variant of the RR scheduling algorithm in which the 
entries in the ready queue are pointers to the PCBs.

a) What would be the effect of putting two pointers to the same process in the 
ready queue?

b) What would be the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme?

c) How would you modify the basic RR algorithm to achieve the same effect 
without the duplicate pointers?
