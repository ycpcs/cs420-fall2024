1) [3 points] Can a multithreaded solution using multiple user-level threads 
achieve better performance on a multiprocessor system than on a single-processor 
system?  Yes or No or “it depends”?  Explain.




2) [3 points] The program shown below uses the Pthreads API.  What would be the 
output from the program at LINE C and LINE P?  Briefly explain how you arrived 
at your answer.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <pthread.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/wait.h>


    int value = 0;
    void *C_runner(void *param);  /* a thread function */
    void *P_runner(void *param);  /* a thread function */


    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        int pid;
        pthread_t tid;
        pthread_attr_t attr;

        pid = fork();

        if (pid == 0) {  /* child process */
            pthread_attr_init(&attr);
            pthread_create(&tid, &attr, C_runner, NULL);
            pthread_join(tid, NULL);
            printf("CHILD: value = %d\n", value);  /* LINE C */
        }
        else if (pid > 0) {  /* parent process */
            wait(NULL);
            pthread_attr_init(&attr);
            pthread_create(&tid, &attr, P_runner, NULL);
            pthread_join(tid, NULL);
            printf("PARENT: value = %d\n", value);  /* LINE P */
        }
    }

    void *C_runner(void *param) {
        value = value + 5;
        pthread_exit(0);
    }
    
    void *P_runner(void *param) {
        value = value + 2;
        pthread_exit(0);
    }




3) [3 points] Consider a multiprocessor system and a multithreaded program 
written using the many-to-many threading model.  Let the number of user-level 
threads in the program be more than the number of processors in the system. 
Discuss the performance implications of the following scenarios.

a) The number of kernel threads allocated to the program is less than the number 
of processors.

b) The number of kernel threads allocated to the program is equal to the number 
of processors.

c) The number of kernel threads allocated to the program is greater than the 
number of processors but less than the number of user-level threads.
