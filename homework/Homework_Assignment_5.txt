1) [3 points] Consider the deadlock situation that could occur in the 
dining-philosophers problem when the philosophers obtain the chopsticks 
one at a time. Discuss how each of the four necessary conditions for deadlock 
indeed hold in this setting. Discuss how deadlocks could be prevented by 
eliminating any one of the four conditions.




2) [3 points] Consider a system consisting of four resources of the same type 
that are shared by three processes, each of which needs at most two resources. 
Show that the system is deadlock-free.




3) Consider the following snapshot of a system:

    Process     Allocation         Max           Need         Available
    -------    ------------    -----------    -----------    -----------
                 A B C D         A B C D        A B C D        A B C D
    -------    ------------    -----------    -----------    -----------
      P0         1 0 1 1         1 0 1 2        _ _ _ _        3 0 0 1
      P1         0 1 0 0         3 4 3 3        _ _ _ _
      P2         1 0 0 0         1 0 1 0        _ _ _ _
      P3         2 2 1 1         3 3 2 1        _ _ _ _
      P4         0 1 1 0         5 1 2 2        _ _ _ _

Answer the following questions using the bankerâ€™s algorithm:

3a) [3 points] What is the content of the matrix Need?

3b) [3 points] Is the system in a safe state?  If so, provide a sequence that 
would allow all processes to run to completion

3c) [3 points] If a request from process P4 arrives for (3,0,0,0), can the 
request be granted immediately (i.e. would the system still be in a safe state 
if the request were granted)?  If so, provide a safe sequence that would allow 
all processes to run to completion.
