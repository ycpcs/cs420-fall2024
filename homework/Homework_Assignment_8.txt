1) Suppose that a disk drive has 5000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive 
is currently serving a request at cylinder 781, and the previous request was at 
cylinder 125.  That is, the read/write head is currently moving from lower 
cylinder values to higher. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO order, is:

    120, 1502, 955, 2134, 1002, 1401, 2100, 1640, 92

Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in 
cylinders) that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests, for each 
of the following disk-scheduling algorithms?

    a) [3 points] FCFS
    b) [3 points] SSTF
    c) [3 points] SCAN 
    d) [3 points] LOOK
    e) [3 points] C-SCAN
    f) [3 points] C-LOOK
