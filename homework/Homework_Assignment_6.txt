1) [3 points] Given five memory partitions of 100 KB, 600 KB, 400 KB, 300 KB, 
and 500 KB (in that order), how would each of the first-fit, best-fit, and 
worst-fit algorithms place processes of 347 KB, 473 KB, 122 KB, and 417 KB 
(in that order)?  Which algorithm makes the most efficient use of memory? 
Note that, when a partition is allocated, the leftover space can be allocated
to other processes.




2) [3 points] Assuming a 2 KB (2048 bytes) page size, what are the page numbers 
and offsets for the following address references (provided as decimal numbers). 
Assume that both pages and page offsets are indexed starting at 0.  That is, the 
first page is page 0.

    a) 2573
    b) 21376
    c) 50000
    d) 511
    e) 16384




3) [3 points] Consider a logical address space of 64 pages with 2048 bytes per 
page; mapped onto a physical memory of 32 frames.

    a) How many bits are required in the logical address?
    b) How many bits are required in the physical address?




4) [3 points] Consider a paging system with the page table stored in memory.

    a) If a memory reference takes 300 nanoseconds, how long does a paged 
       memory reference take?
    b) If we add associative registers, and 80 percent of all page-table 
       references are found in the associative registers, what is the effective 
       memory reference time? (Assume that finding a page-table entry in the 
       associative registers takes zero time if the entry is there.)
