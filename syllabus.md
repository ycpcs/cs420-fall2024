### Course Description

This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of operating systems. Topics include interprocess communication, process scheduling, deadlock, memory management, virtual memory, file systems, and distributed systems. Formal principles are illustrated with examples and case studies of one or more contemporary operating systems. Also, students will study a widely used operating system such as Windows or UNIX with an emphasis on system programming for the operating system. Topics include kernel design, the I/O system, scheduling algorithms, process control, interprocess communication, system calls, and memory management.


**Prerequisites:**	CS340 or ECE260 with a grade of 2.0 or higher<br>
**Credit:**		3 credit hours<br>
**Text:**		Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne<br>

### Late Policy

All homework assignments must be submitted by the specified due date. Solutions will be posted on the course website or discussed in class on the specified due date. Late homework submissions will not be accepted, not even for partial credit. If you have some valid reason for needing more time on a homework assignment, then you should contact me at least two days before the deadline to request an extension. Last-minute requests will only be met in exceptional circumstances. If you cannot complete the entire homework assignment on time, you should submit what you have done by the specified due date for partial credit.

For programming assignments, late assignments will be marked down 20% per day late. **No credit will be given for assignments that are more than three (3) days late.**

### Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and participate in class activities and discussions. If a student is planning to miss a class, please notify the professor in advance. Students are responsible for all material covered in class. Students are also expected to keep up with all assigned readings and have read them prior to attending class.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



### Classroom Etiquette

While in class, you are expected to act in a professional manner and be respectful of **all** those around you. Examples of unacceptable classroom behaviors include, but are not limited to:
* excessive talking
* interrupting or speaking over colleagues
* using profanity and/or other inappropriate language
* making derogatory remarks
* making inappropriate jokes
* singing, humming, or other distracting noises

If you fail to abide by these standards you may be asked to leave for the remainder of the class period.

### Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss course material with other students. Discussing the text, lecture notes, assignments and their solutions, is a great way to expose yourself to different approaches to thinking about the material. For many of the problems assigned in this class there will be no single right answer. Comparing multiple solutions to the same problem can help you to develop of much deeper understanding of the material. However, everything that you turn in must be your own work, unless instructed otherwise. If you work on assignments with another student or students, you need to explicitly list those students on the work you submit. If you found information on a website or in other materials (books, papers, etc.) then cite them as well. There is no penalty for naming who you worked with or listing other references. However, you will lose credit if you do not list someone with whom you collaborated, or other resources. You are not allowed to copy answers or parts of answers from anyone else, or from material you find on the Internet or elsewhere. This will be considered as willful cheating, and will be dealt with as a violation of the Academic Integrity code.

### Academic Integrity

York College's mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the faculty member must promptly notify the student in writing and obtain confirmation of notification from the student.  The faculty member then has ten business days from that written notification to the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic dishonesty will be kept on file in the student's permanent record. The faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable penalty for the student, up to a course grade of 0.  This discretion is limited to the course in which the dishonesty took place.  Students may not withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty, unless and until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member or is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Dean of Academic Affairs.

Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned must discuss the situation with the faculty member and have 10 business days thereafter to submit an appeal to Student Welfare Committee through the Dean of Academic Affairs. If an appeal is filed, the Student Welfare Committee will then conduct a hearing to review the charge and/or sanction.  In the case of an egregious first offense, the faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation, suspension or dismissal from the College.

If the Dean of Academic Affairs determines that the academic dishonesty is the student's second offense, the Dean will provide written notification to the student, the faculty member, and the Department Chair. The Student Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the charge and decide on an appropriate sanction, which will involve academic probation, suspension or dismissal from the College. Students who believe the Student Welfare Committee has unjustly sanctioned them may submit a written appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs within 72 hours of receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee's sanction.

### Personal Technology Policy

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate.  The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers.  Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations.  In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking.  Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.
